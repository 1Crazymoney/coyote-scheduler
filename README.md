An experimental C++ library for **language-agnostic systematic concurrency testing** by the
[Coyote](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/) team in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).

The library provides APIs that allow you to instrument your runtime for (1) declaring concurrent
_operations_ and synchronization _resources_. (2) taking control of these operations and resources,
and (3) systematically exploring _interleavings_.

The library exposes an FFI for interop with other languages.

To learn more about the research behind our technology, check out our published papers
[here](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/learn/resources/publications).
